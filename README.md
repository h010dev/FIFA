# FIFA
Status: On-hold due to scalability costs. 

## About me: 

My educational background is in business management, but I developed a profound interest in machine learning during an elective I took in statistical modelling techniques. Since then I have been pursuing additional knowledge in the vast field of machine learning and data science, with the goal of pursuing a career in the respective fields.

## Background: 

I started this project with the goal to expand my knowledge in the area of data science and machine learning, particularly in the areas relating to data engineering.  I chose to work with FIFA data in particular because of the vast array of options it offers for data exploration, and because I understand the data I will be working with, making it easy to derive the context behind the models I will be exploring.

Another goal with this project is to make it portable and scalable. I have decided to use Docker to assist in that area.
